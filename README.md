**2️⃣ Analytic Platform with end - end ETL Data Pipeline For Trending YouTube Video Statistics via AWS** ⇢ [Visit ETL_AWS Folder](https://github.com/KunalAnand2907/Youtube-Data-Mining-Analytics-End-End-Data-Engineering-Data-Science-Project/tree/master/Part2_ETL_Aws)

#### 📚 Overview

A fully automated ETL Data Pipeline designed to extract, clean, and analyze YouTube trending video data from multiple regions/Countries — leveraging AWS services for scalable processing, schema handling, and real-time analytics.
The platform securely handles structured and semi-structured data (JSON, CSV, Parquet) to uncover insights across key metrics such as ideo categories (Entertainment, Science and fiction, etc), Video Tile and desc, Channel Name & ID, Likes & Description, comments & its count.

#### 🧩 Workflow Summary:

Built from scratch using AWS serverless architecture:

1️⃣ **Raw Data Ingestion →** Uploaded regional/Diff. Countries JSON and Partitioned CSV files based on Regional Tag (Ind.csv, eng.csv, etc.) into 2 S3 Raw Bucket. <br>
2️⃣ **Schema Discovery →** Created AWS Glue Catalog; handled nested JSON struct arrays via preprocessing. <br>
3️⃣ **Automated Cleansing →** Used AWS Lambda triggers on S3 PUT events to clean and append data into S3 (Cleansed Bucket). <br>
4️⃣ **Data Transformation →** Executed PySpark Glue Jobs with Glue Bookmarks for schema normalization, null handling, and outlier's treatment. <br>
5️⃣ **Data Integration/ Combining →** Performed inner joins on category IDs and stored curated datasets into S3 (Analytic Bucket). <br>
6️⃣ **Query & Analysis →** Queried partitioned data with Athena, storing query output & metadata into 2 different named as: <code>a. S3 (Athena Output Bucket)</code>, <code>b.) S3 (Logs Athena Query Bucket)</code> <br>
7️⃣ **Visualization & Insights →** Leveraged QuickSight Dashboards to track KPIs like mentioned below, & create diff. data driven dashboards including various Graphs & Charts. <br>

**➔ Top/Bottom 10 trending videos by region** &nbsp; **➔ Category-wise views, likes, & comment counts** &nbsp; **➔ Global vs. regional performance trends**

📚 **Services:**

<ul>
<li><b>S3:</b> Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides manufacturing scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
<li><b>IAM (Users, Groups & Role):</b> This is nothing but identity and access management which enables us to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
<li><b>QuickSight:</b> Amazon QuickSight is a scalable, serverless, embeddable, machine learning-powered business intelligence (BI) service built for the cloud.
<li><b>Glue (Crawler, Studio & Glue Catlog):</b> A serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development.
<li><b>Lambda:</b> Lambda is a computing service that allows programmers to run code without creating or managing servers.
<li><b>Athena:</b> Athena is an interactive query service for S3 in which there is no need to load data it stays in S3.
<li><b>SNS:</b> A distributed publish/subscribe solution used for application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication. SNS topics are used to enable communication: producers publish messages to topics, and consumers subscribe to these topics to receive messages. You can deliver messages to various types of subscribers, such as AWS SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, and HTTP endpoints. You can also use SNS to send SMS messages, email, and push notifications to end-user devices.
<li><b>Cloudwatch & Logs:</b> It enables you to monitor your complete stack (applications, infrastructure, network, and services) and use alarms, logs, and events data to take automated actions and reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR). This frees up important resources and allows you to focus on building applications and business value.
</ul>

**3️⃣ YouTube Data Scraping → Transformation → Preprocessing → EDA → NLP-based Text Mining (with RAG) ⇢** [Visit DataScrapping_Viz_Nlp_Tasks Folder](https://github.com/KunalAnand2907/Youtube-Data-Mining-Analytics-End-End-Data-Engineering-Data-Science-Project/tree/master/Part3_DataScrapping_Viz_Nlp_Tasks)

#

This module is split into two major components:

**▶️ Part 1: Automated YouTube Data Extraction, Cleaning & Insightful Visual Analytics**

⇢ Using the YouTube Data API, the pipeline scrapes topic-specific content (e.g., Data Science) and captures rich metadata::
<ul>
<li> <b> Channel-level attributes: </b>
Channel Name, Subscribers, Total Views, Video Count, Playlist ID
<li> <b> Video-level attributes: </b>
Title, Description, Video ID, Publish Date, Likes, Dislikes, Views, Comments
<li> After data collection, extensive data wrangling + preprocessing operations are performed, followed by univariate, bivariate, and multivariate EDA using interactive charts and visualizations.
<li> This part essentially turns raw YouTube metadata into clean, structured insights—ready for downstream NLP tasks.
</ul>

# 

📄🔍 **Part 2: NLP-Powered Text Mining & Category Prediction (RAG Enhanced)**

⇢ A full end-to-end text analytics workflow is built on YouTube video statistics and metadata:

#### 🔤 Text Preprocessing Pipeline
<ol>
<li>Tokenization (sentence, word)
<li>Regex cleaning (remove punctuation, special chars, extra whitespaces)
<li>Stopword removal
<li>Stemming & Lemmatization
<li>POS Tagging & Named Entity Recognition
</ol>

#### 🧠 Word Embeddings based on MTEB Research Paper

<ul>
<li>Frequency based: Bag of Words, TF-IDF
<li>Prediction/ DL-based: Word2Vec, Glove
<li>Transformers/ LSTM Based: Open AI Embedder, Ollama, Gemini, Hugging Face, Elmmo, Qdrant 
</ul>

#### 🏗️ Model Development & 🔄 Evaluation
<ul>
<li>Training supervised models to predict Category_ID (Y) from Video Title (X)
<li>Hyperparameter tuning and performance comparison across multiple embedding strategies
<li>Final mapping of Category_ID to 16 YouTube content categories (e.g., Music, Sports, Tech, Entertainment, Vlogs, News, etc.)
</ul>

**✨ Section Focus:**
This section showcases the full lifecycle—from raw YouTube data → structured analytics → deep NLP modeling—demonstrating how to extract knowledge, classify content, and power intelligent search/RAG systems on top of unstructured YouTube data.
